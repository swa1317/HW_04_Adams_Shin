1. Who was on the team?
    Samuel Adams and Bahdah Shin

2. For Person Adams: (2)
    a. Which number did you have?
        452
    b. What were the set of best parameters your program finds?
        roll = -20.5598
        tilt = -7.6369
        twist = -18.7880
    c. To at least six digits past the decimal point, what was the fraction of the water you could fit
        into the birdbath using your numbers?
        0.4994443180890335

3. For Person Shin: (2)
    a. Which number did you have?
        423
    b. What were the set of best parameters your program finds?
        roll = -24.9162
        tilt = 16.3636
        twist = -8.4772
    c. To at least six digits past the decimal point, what was the fraction of the water you could fit
        into the birdbath using your numbers?
        0.4977630741037475

4. What approach or approaches did you use? (2)
    We decided to use axially-aligned gradient descent. We felt as though this was the best function to gain experience
    with and apply to the Bird Bath Function. To test our results from this function, we also implemented brute force;
    our results were similar so we knew that we were on the right track.

5. How did the work breakdown structure go with the team? (1)
    For this homework, Bahdah and Samuel remained a team just as with last homework. We feel as though we work together
    well because we balance out each other's strengths in creating a thorough solution to the problem. For this particular
    assignment, Samuel began with the initial layout of the given files and started to piece together a connection to
    axially-aligned gradient descent. Bahdah then continued to complete the function to achieve our best values. Finally,
    Samuel used to values to draw a conclusion and complete the assignment's documentation.

6. Is the idea of a team homework idea helping to reduce stress? (1)
    The team homework assignments are helping to manage stress because it divides the work load so that we can each


7. Rosenbrock’s Banana: (1)
    Look up the function called Rosenbrock’s Banana. Write three paragraphs about it. Why is it
    famous? How does it apply to this homework assignment? What makes it difficult? What is
    Nelder-Mead optimization? Can you generate a plot of this (optional).
8. Conclusion and Summary: (1)
    What else did you learn along the way here? What else can you conclude?
    What did you learn about? Dr. K expects at least two solid paragraphs here.
9. Bonus B: (1)
    Implement a convex optimization program to find the minima of Rosenbrock’s Banana
    function, from methods described in class.
    Work with the function f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2
