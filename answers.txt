1. Who was on the team?
    Samuel Adams and Bahdah Shin

2. For Person Shin: (2)
    a. Which number did you have?
        423

    b. What were the set of best parameters your program finds?
        roll = -24.916290268467062 in degrees
        tilt = 16.363636363636353 in degrees
        twist = -8.477221653405712 in degrees.

    c. To at least six digits past the decimal point, what was the fraction of the water you could fit
        into the birdbath using your numbers?
        0.4977630741037475

3. For Person Adams: (2)
    a. Which number did you have?
        452

    b. What were the set of best parameters your program finds?
        roll = -20.559829612232672 in degrees
        tilt = -7.636917225518063 in degrees
        twist = -18.78808510206095 in degrees.

    c. To at least six digits past the decimal point, what was the fraction of the water you could fit
        into the birdbath using your numbers?
        0.4994443180890335

4. What approach or approaches did you use? (2)
    We used the axially aligned gradient descent.

    Did you use two different methods?
        We used on method.

    Did you try other methods?
        We did not try the other methods.

    Did you have any complications along the way?
        I didn't realize that the bird function was given to us in the email.
        This was realized later in the day.
        
5. How did the work breakdown structure go with the team? (1)
    Did you take the opportunity to meet someone new?
    How did you assure that both of you contributed?

    For this homework, Bahdah and Samuel remained a team just as with last homework. We feel as though we work together
    well because we balance out each other's strengths in creating a thorough solution to the problem. For this particular
    assignment, Samuel began with the initial layout of the given files and started to piece together a connection to
    axially-aligned gradient descent. Bahdah then continued to complete the function to achieve our best values. Finally,
    Samuel used to values to draw a conclusion and complete the assignment's documentation.

6. Is the idea of a team homework idea helping to reduce stress? (1)
7. Rosenbrock’s Banana: (1)
    Look up the function called Rosenbrock’s Banana. Write three paragraphs about it. Why is it
    famous? How does it apply to this homework assignment? What makes it difficult? What is
    Nelder-Mead optimization? Can you generate a plot of this (optional).
8. Conclusion and Summary: (1)
    What else did you learn along the way here? What else can you conclude?
    What did you learn about? Dr. K expects at least two solid paragraphs here.
9. Bonus B: (1)
    Implement a convex optimization program to find the minima of Rosenbrock’s Banana
    function, from methods described in class.
    Work with the function f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2
